                <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                <p class="main">
                    Indian Army is mandated to safeguard National Interests from External Aggression and Internal Subversion.
                    The mechanised battlefield is exceptionally demanding and requires enormous reserves of physical, mental 
                    and moral stamina to get through the 'noise and dust'. The Armoured Corps ethos reflects professional 
                    competence and makes demands on individual soldiers far beyond those necessary in other vocations. 
                    The Indian Armoured Corp's operational success continues to be founded on moral strength and martial
                    spirit, and it takes tremendous pride in the achievements of the past, seizes the demands and opportunities 
                    of the present, and focuses always on the challenges of the future. At the core lies the enduring principles
                    of the Fire Power and Shock Action, the application of which will always have a most devastating effect on
                    the enemy.

                <h2>Formation</h2>
                <p class="main">
                    Upon the Partition of India and Indian independence in 1947, four of the ten Gurkha regiments were
                    transferred to the British Army. The rest of the British Indian Army was divided between the newly
                    created nations of India and Pakistan. The Punjab Boundary Force, which had been formed to help police 
                    the Punjab during the partition period, was disbanded.Headquarters Delhi and the East Punjab
                    Command were formed to administer the area.<br>Army Day is celebrated on 15 January every year
                    in India, in recognition of Lieutenant General K. M. Cariappa's taking over as the first 
                    commander-in-chief of the Indian Army from General Sir Francis Butcher, the last British 
                    commander-in-chief of India, on 15 January 1949. With effect from 26 January 1950, the date 
                    India became a republic, all active-duty Indian Army officers formerly holding the King's
                    Commission were recommissioned and confirmed in their substantive ranks.

                    While constantly reviewing its operational preparedness/ postures to meet the perceived

                <h3>Bilateral relations with China:</h3>
                    <p class="para">
                        
                             Relations between the two nations have improved over the 
                            past few years. Constructive engagement at the political, diplomatic and military level is
                            continuing with regular military exchanges from time to time. Defence Ministers of
                            both countries visited each other's country as part of increased bilateral exchanges.<br>
                            India desires peaceful and cordial relations with all neighbours, including China. 
                            Towards this end, a policy of constructive engagement and of maintaining peace and tranquility
                            along the LAC is ensured. Concurrently, necessary development of infrastructure and improved
                            military preparedness including force modernisation, continues to meet the present and future 
                            security challenges.

                            The situation along India-China
                            border continues to be peaceful. There are a few areas along the border where India and China
                            have differing perception of the LAC. Both sides patrol up to their respective perceptions of LAC. 
                            Specific cases of transgressions by Chinese patrols into such areas across LAC are taken up with
                            Chinese authorities through the established mechanism of Hot Lines, Flag Meetings and Border 
                            Personnel Meetings.
