            Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity â€” the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, 
        Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids.<br>
        It is very huge and made up of gases. The pulling force of the sun binds the entire solar system.<br>
        The Sun is the hottest and the largest body in our Solar system. It is made of extremely hot gases, but
        we don't feel its heat too strongly because it is a 150 million kilometres away from us. It is the ultimate
        source of light and energy all across our solar system.
