    William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software developer, and philanthropist. He is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation.
    areer at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.
   <span id="micro">Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985.</span> <br><br>
    Entrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates and his business partner Paul Allen founded and built the world's largest software business, Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Gates announced that he was stepping down as Microsoft's chairman to focus on charitable work at his foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

<h2 class="bi">Success according to him</h2>
<p>The top takeaway that I found useful for entrepreneurs juggling intense workloads and schedules came from an early lesson Gates had to learn: delegation.

    In the early days of Microsoft, Gates recalled, he was doing what he had been most passionate about since the age of 13--writing software. He would do most of the code and edit most of other people's code. But he knew his obsession with programming wasn't sustainable if the company was to scale, so he chose to trust in other people's coding skills and let go of the rein.
    
    As the company grew, he had to delegate what he knew to be one of his weaknesses since he was a kid to other people's natural strengths. In this case, it was people management. </p>
